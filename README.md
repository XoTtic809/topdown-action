3. **Weapon Upgrades** - Always grab gold star power-ups - they're rare and permanent!
4. **Combo Maintenance** - Keep moving and killing to maintain high combos for bonus points
5. **Power-Up Timing** - Save shields and speed boosts for boss waves
6. **Wave Breaks** - Use HP restoration between waves to recover
7. **Boss Patterns** - Learn the rotating bullet patterns and find safe zones

### Player Settings
```javascript
// Line ~210
this.speed = 250;        // Movement speed

```

### Difficulty Scaling
```javascript
// Line ~850
const spawnRate = Math.max(0.4, 1.6 - wave * 0.07);  // Enemy spawn speed
const enemiesNeeded = wave * 5 + 12;                  // Enemies per wave
```

### Power-Up Settings
```javascript
// Line ~740
const dropChance = e.type === 'miniboss' ? 0.4 : 0.2;  // Drop chance
player.rapidFire = 12;                                   // Duration
```

### Visual Effects
